Food is good but not great. \n\nWe had the calamari and Thai tiger shrimp to start. Maybe 5-6 calamari rings and 2 tiger shrimps grilled nicely topped with a bed of salad in a sweet balsamic vinegrette dressing, likely to make the dish look more full of food. They also provide warm bread with hummus and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start. We ordered the seafood risotto and spicy calbrese pizza as entrees. Risotto was good but it was more like a paella rather than what I was expecting for risotto. Pizza was thin and crispy but for some reason a bit tough to cut despite them giving me what resembled a steak knife to cut it up with. What I really liked was their chilli oil. If you like spicy, ask for that. It's apparently made in house (what the server told me). Best part of my meal was their chilli oil. \n\nSince I was just at Basilico restaurant last week, I can easily compare the risotto and pizza to Basilico's. I would say Basilico had better food. BUT, I enjoyed the service at this restaurant. Wait staff don't seem to be assigned to just \"their\" tables. They help each other out and just service your table as needed and as they see fit so you don't wait long for service. Also, food comes out way faster here vs Basilico. Within 5 minutes we had our starter and within 15 minutes of ordering we had our entrees (but maybe it's worth the wait at Basilico since the food was more well prepared). Dessert came in 5 minutes of ordering. \n\nAs for alcoholic drinks, I wouldn't recommend the old fashioned. Missing brown sugar, orange peel, and overall doesn't get close to what a good old fashioned tastes like. TheB-52 coffee was good, though - shot of espresso mixed with Bailey's, Khalua and one other liqueur (escaping my mind at the moment) and topped with whipped cream. \n\nFor dessert, we had the apple and cranberry crumble topped with ice cream. I wouldn't recommend it. It's OK but too much sauce and not enough crumble and I don't even recall tasting much cranberry. \n\nOverall, a good experience and I'd come back since I live in Kleinburg and it's minutes away and located in the Kleinburg Village.", "date": "2018-02-24 20:02:11", "batch_id": 9}

Two thumbs up for the warm bread and hummus that was also replenished during the evening. Perhaps an olive tapenade would have made me even happier. My friend and I ordered the gnocchi with a sauce substitution of wild boar instead of the gorgonzola on the menu. They were very accommodating and we are still raving about how delicious it was and how tender the meat was. One friend ordered the salmon, which she says she will return for, she loved the root vegetables and drizzle that came with it. Another friend had the baked pasta with vegetables. It tasted better than it looked. The only reason I gave this review a 4 and not a 5 is because the pizza was good but not great.

We ordered a large matcha one that came to about $11. It was quite large for 2 people and we were full after finishing that, so I would recommend the smaller one. There was a healthy amount of matcha powder sprinkled on top of the shaved ice, along with some red beans, whipped cream and a scoop of matcha ice cream on top. The bf was very pleased with this shaved ice, saying the flavors were great. It didn't melt very fast which was great since I'm a slower eater. The ice is very finely shaved and it looked like snow. I'm always around this area but have never stepped into this place for dessert so I'll be sure to come and try the other flavors next time!", "date": "2018-06-23 03:48:05", "batch_id": 9}

The place was packed with about 200 people all there for a nice night out. \n      I want to say that I appreciate the authenticity of the bowling lanes and the owners not falling to the pressure of modernizing them. It's what makes mahalls special,  you can go anywhere for computer screens and moonrock bowling. It gives you a feel for what bowling was really like in the old days which is pretty cool. \n      Next I wanted to address the food. A friend of mine recommended the fried chicken claiming it was the best in lakewood, which is a high standard to live up to but I must say I was not disappointed.  I also like that they offer a variety of tacos (vegan especially).  It's not often a bowling alley/concert venue offers much more than fries and microwaved soft pretzles.\n      Now with all the things that mahalls offers you can imagine it might be pretty packed on a Saturday night with 2 stages for music,  20 bowling lanes and amazing food. Not to mention an assortment of signature cocktails and an interesting selection of bottled beers and drafts that are not carried everywhere you go. It's nice to put the bud light down for a minute and try something that was made with a little more creativity and care. And for how busy it was i was very impressed with the timelyness of my service and appreciated the zest the bartenders had for serving as many people as they could as fast as they could.\n      I will definitely return soon and often.  Thank you Mahalls for a wonderful night.  Keep up the good work!", "date": "2015-01-21 16:25:33", "batch_id": 9}

Greeted right when we went in, my sister and I opted for the student special (crispy coated fries with a drink plus a gourmet cheezeburger for 3.49 extra) with a mushroom cheezeburger (he didn't charge us extra for it). The burger and fries came beautifully on a cutting board, presentation was beyond my expectations from a burger place. The fries were amazing, they tasted similar to Cosco fries and the special sauce was unique & delicious! The cheeseburger was really fresh, the patty was well cooked & the mushrooms complemented it. It was also less messy to eat as well. To add, service was top notch. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad this place opened and I can't wait to come back!!!!

Was in the area and was planning to go to Pomegranate but saw the Yelp ad for this place and I had never been so decided to check it out.  It's very similar to your average juice shop of juices, smoothies, and Brazilian bowls.  Lady taking order was very nice and helpful.  She told me their is a naturopath  adjacent to them that is slightly closed off by a wall.  I forgot the pricing but the lady was not there when I went in the morning hours.  Interesting twist to a juice shop.  \n\nOne unique thing they offer here is you can make up your own juice by picking first a base of carrot, apple, cucumber or celery  and then add up to 4 different items of greens and root veggies like beets.  This way you can get total greens with no sugar up to the sweeter fruits and veggies.  I Decided to try there green drink special Vonda's special which was with different greens  but don't remember exactly everything in the drink.  I have yet to try the smoothies but I was told that all cream smoothies can be made with either yogurt or made vegan with coconut cream.  Will need to try one next time.\n\nPrices for juices are between 8-10 buckaroos which is within reason for juice shops these days. All in all it's a nice little shop but with Pomegranate down the street it's going to be hard for them to get me to want to come here if I had the choice.", "date": "2017-10-21 16:39:56", "batch_id": 9}

I know some think the more something costs the better it is, but often it just isnt and this is one of those times.", "date": "2012-07-22 04:45:51", "batch_id": 9}

This place is my cup of cake, hands down. And I've tried a lot of cupcakes. Last week I had to bash a fellow indian's business, but this week I get to promote one. \n\nI know cupcakes are a splurge, but these ones are really worth your $2.75 and here's why:\n- They are sized just right, not too large or too big, leaving your sweet tooth satisfied and your stomach still stable. \n- The frosting is fantastic, you can eat it alone and it isn't sickly sweet, and it's not piled on so high that it topples once you take a bite. No overkill here, just a well balanced amount of buttercream.\n- The cake is moist yet fluffy and light, not overly dense, certainly not dry. \n- The flavors rock and there's a lot of variety! The Savannah (classic red velvet) is splendid, the Duracelle (carrot walnut) is delish, the Betsy comes adorned with bits of dark chocolate, and hi, they have nutella filled cupcakes! Nut kidding! Their dark chocolate cakes pass my high standards, and I really can walk away from this place feeling great. \n\nNow I need to go back for their thirsty thursday specials, yes, it's what you think, liquor laced cupcakes. What a fantastic idea. \n\nBlushing has really perfected the art of making a cupcake and it's a great mood booster to have a well-made cupcake. What's more, the art shines through in their beautiful custom-made decorations too, which is why I'm using them for an engagement party we are having. Little delectable pieces of edible art, I love it.\n\nThe staff is friendly, you can tell the owner takes pride in her cakes, and they have a little kiosk in the South Park mall too.\n\nSo, skip SAS's sad cupcakes and try Blushing instead. You won't regret it.", "date": "2010-08-27 21:12:03", "batch_id": 9}

I always go for the Beef Flautas (I can never finish this meal due to how much food they give you).  A flauta is a tortilla wrapped around a meat and cheese and then deep fried.  They give you a choice of flour or wheat tortilla - you get 6 pieces of the flautas that fill up the rim/edge of your plate (3 full flautas cut in half).  It doesn't end there - You get many fixings that you can pick/choose from (onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, guacamole, etc.) All of these fixings are located in the center of you plate.  If that isn't enough, you can make a meal of it and get a drink with sides of beans and rice.  This is definitely a wonderful lunch with plenty of tasty food at a great price.\n\nTip:  Tijuana Flats has an amazing hot sauce bar.

I can see they are making slight efforts in creating a more inviting space but I think they have ways to go; get rid of those tacky track lights!\n\nAnyhow, I did not have the opportunity to try their coffee as their teas greatly overshadow any sort of coffee offering they may have.

I must admit my previous review is a bit harsh but that's just how I am; I prefer the ugly truth over a pretty lie.

The restaurant itself is located in an old mansion, yet the atmosphere is a little lacking as it's on the dark side and lacking in unifying decor.  But the food more than makes up for it and the service is superb; a very friendly, accommodating and helpful staff whom are present just enough to fulfill all needs yet not be intrusive.\n\nMy husband and I couldn't decide (or agree!) on an appetizer, as they all looked so good, so we ordered the Ethnic Sampler which gave us a fairly substantial taste of the samosa (fried pastry with spicy vegetable filling), vegetable cutlet (deep fried vegetable patties) and mirchi bajji (deep friend chilies stuffed with chutney), enough for two diners so if there are more people in your party you'll want to order more than one.  My husband preferred the samosas and I the mirchi bajji, but we agreed that all were excellent so it's really a matter of personal taste.\n\nWe usually order our entrees with naan, any of them are good but my favorite is the garlic naan, which is not too greasy but still soft and fragrant and not at all dry.  In the past, we have also ordered the aloo paratha, which I considered a bit less flavorful and more dry than the naan--again, probably personal taste and having to do with the fact that it's made with potatoes. \n\nThe entrees themselves are excellent and so far I haven't had one I haven't liked, but there are two that stand above all the others.  Oddly enough my favorite is a rice dish, Chicken Biryani, which is not necessarily an entree though I order it as one.  The seasoning and spices used are amazing--very unique--it's very spicy with big chunks of high quality, lean chicken and it comes with a mellow yogurt sauce that helps tone down some of the heat.  My second favorite is the Chicken Pepper Fry, again, very spicy with a complex taste and loads of black pepper.  The one thing Tamarind gets right over and over is spiciness!  I've also had the Chicken Vindaloo, Curry and Aloo Gobi Masala, all very good.  \n\nI've always been too full to order dessert so I can't help you out there, though the mango lassi's are wonderful and refreshing.  I always finish mine up with the appetizer and wish I had more later on.\n\nAlso of note, there's a Dinner for Two Sunday night special that is a phenomenal deal; $25 gets you an appetizer, a bread and two entrees, which is more than enough for two diners.  There are only a few restrictions which are listed clearly in the menu.  Tuesday night is Dosa Night, order one get the second 50% off, and Wednesday night is Student Night, order one entree get the second 50% off, with appropriate student ID.", "date": "2011-03-22 21:13:37", "batch_id": 9}

Keep infecting yelp with lies and slanders, for what?  your review only show what a narrow mind person you really are.  You are like the crazy guys that stand in middle of the roads yelling blaspheme that no one will ever pay any attention. Be a better man and help someone instead of going online and threaten people with little comment like restaurant have to kiss your hinds in order to get 5 star reviews.

They advertise that you can collect 1 Scene point for every $3 spent at Milestones. Additionally, you can redeem 1000 Scene points for $10 off your bill. When it came to collecting Scene points, the waitress claimed that only 1 person could collect at our table of 20, even though we each paid individually. Secondly, when it came to redeeming Scene points, they were unable to do so. It was not until we spoke to the manager that they said we could still redeem the points, but it would take a while longer to create individual bills. We had been at Milestones for nearly 3 hours at that point and just wanted to leave and get on with our day, and so we elected to just pay for our meals without redeeming our Scene points.\n\nThe chaos that ensued from the simple request of collecting and redeeming Scene points - a program that's been in existence for at least 5 years - is unacceptable.\n\nTo make matters worse, the waitresses and manager handled the situation in an unprofessional manner. Not only did they give us attitude throughout the process, the manager blamed the entire ordeal on Scene and their poor implementation.

It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers.", "date": "2015-05-02 15:52:15", "batch_id": 9}
